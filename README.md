# GD3-drug-structures

This repository contains the SDF structure files of candidate small molecules identified through transcriptomic-guided drug repositioning analysis in Gaucher Disease Type 3 (GD3).

These structures were used to generate 3D molecular visualizations in PyMOL, aiding in the interpretation of their pharmacological relevance.

---

## Drug Candidates Included

The following compounds were shortlisted from L1000CDSÂ² analysis for their potential therapeutic roles in GD3:

- AZD-7762  
- HY-10992  
- Trametinib  
- TGX-221  
- PD-0325901  
- NVP-TAE684  
- Mitoxantrone  

All files are provided in `.sdf` format and were downloaded from [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

---

## Usage

You can load each `.sdf` file into PyMOL or similar molecular visualization software to:

- Examine 3D molecular conformation  
- Identify heteroatoms, functional groups, and aromatic rings  
- Assess pharmacophore features  
- Capture rendered images for publication/presentation
